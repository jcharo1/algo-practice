# Code design 
In this problem I decided to implent a Trie or Prefix Tree due to its structure that store a dynamic set of strings.

    
# Time Efficiency
Time Efficiency for this problem is `O(m*n)` m being the number of paths in a trie and n being the length of each path 

# Space Complexity
Space complexity of this problem `O(n)`
