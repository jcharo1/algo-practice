Priority Queues - Intuition
Consider the following scenario -

A doctor is working in an emergency wing at a hospital. When patients come in, a nurse checks their symptoms and based on the severity of the illness, sends them to the doctor. For e.g.
a guy who has had an accident is sent before someone who has come with a runny nose. But there is a slight problem. There is only one nurse and only one doctor. 
In the amount of time nurse takes to check the symptoms, the doctor has to work alone with the patients, hurting their overall productivity.

You are a ninja programmer. The doctor comes to you for help. Your job is to write a small software in which patients will enter their symptoms and will receive a priority number based on their illness. 
The doctor has given you a list of common ailments, and the priority in which he would prefer seeing them. How would you solve the priority problem?

Functionality
If we were to create a PriorityQueue class, what methods would it need to have?

Here are the two key methods:

insert - insert an element
remove - remove an element
And we can also add the same utility methods that we had in our regular Queue class:

front - returns the element at the front of the queue
size - returns the number of elements present in the queue
is_empty - returns True if there are no elements in the queue, and False otherwise
As part of this functionality, we will need a way of assigning priorities to the items.

A very common way to solve the patient-doctor problem mentioned above would be to assign each ailment a priority. For e.g.

* A running nose may be assigned priority 1
* Fever may be assigned 2
* Accident may get a priority 10
